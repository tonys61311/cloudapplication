To some the delightful freshness and humour of
Northanger Abbey,
its


completeness, finish, and
entrain,
obscure the undoubted critical facts that its


scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that of burlesque or parody, a kind in


which the first rank is reached with difficulty.
Persuasion,
relatively faint in


tone, and not enthralling in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the


others its exquisite delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of
Mansfield


Park
is admittedly theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author


has almost
wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that


Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might


very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous.
